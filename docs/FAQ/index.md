# Frequently Asked Questions

As this site grows it gets harder to know where to find information,
so this page is a collection of frequently asked questions.

Please add to this list!

Also make sure to check that your question was not already answered on [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/tag/bids).

It will always be ðŸš§ **in construction** ðŸš§
and we really encourage everyone to update it to be more useful.
If there's a question you've asked or answered more than twice
then it's an FAQ and it should be in the repository.

Ideally the questions will link to an answer elsewhere
to maximize the different ways of finding out more about BIDS.
