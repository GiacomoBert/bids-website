## Executive Summary

The Steering Group started this meeting discussing and learning how the Maintainers balanced incorporating multiple BEPs in a short time frame. We went over our lessons learned and potential enhancements to the process. The Steering Group discussed further potential plans for [OHBMâ€™s Open Science Room](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2021/).
