The BIDS community is preparing to merge the BIDS Extension Proposal 30 (BEP030) for Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).





The updated draft is available for review at:

[https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modality-specific-files/near-infrared-spectroscopy.html](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modality-specific-files/near-infrared-spectroscopy.html)

Note that the content of that HTML page may change as suggestions are accepted during the review process.
Comments and suggestions may be submitted on GitHub at:

[https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/802](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/802)

The community review will close on Wednesday (Sept 14th) at 23:59 UTC.
If no larger issues occur, all open comments and suggestions will be resolved in the following days and merged into the BEP. Afterwards, the BEP will be merged into the BIDS specification, followed by a 5-business-day long feature freeze and the release of BIDS 1.8.0 (then containing NIRS as a modality, among several more minor changes as documented in the BIDS changelog).

For more details on the release protocol, please see:

We look forward to hearing your feedback!
