title: "How do I upload my BIDS App to the BIDS App Github org?"
---

You can release BIDS Apps using your own or your lab's account.
However, if you want to be added to the BIDS docker hub,
please message the [BIDS maintainers](mailto:bids.maintenance+apps@gmail.com)
to have a repo created for you.

If you base your code on <https://github.com/bids-apps/example> deployment on
docker hub will happen automatically via Circle-ci.

If you want your App to show on the BIDS App website
[here](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/apps/), you will in any case have to
update the `_config.yml` in the
[BIDS App website repository](https://github.com/bids-apps/bids-apps.github.io.git).
