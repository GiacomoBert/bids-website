title: "Can I add more arguments to the API of my App?"
---

Every BIDS App must use the mandatory arguments mentioned above, but you are
free to add more that are specific to the task your App will perform.

We recommend you follow the guidelines mentioned in the
[BIDS extension proposal 027](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/bep027)
for more information on specifying the API of your App.
