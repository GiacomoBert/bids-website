title: "Is there a BIDS App template?"
---

Have a look at the
[example BIDS App repository](https://github.com/bids-apps/example). A
minimalist example of a BIDS App consisting of a Dockerfile and a simple entry
point script (written in this case in Python) accepting the standard BIDS Apps
command line arguments.
