title: "What the kinds of analysis levels (`participant` and `group`) mean?"
---

Generally, `participant` means individual level analysis (for instance: single
subject) The group level analysis can be thought of as the second step, where
the input becomes the output of the `participant` level analysis.

For example, generating statistic maps of each subject's brain could be
considered `participant`, while generating the average of these maps across the
dataset could be considered `group`.
